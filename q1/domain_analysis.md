# Domain Analysis: Educational Technology (EdTech Math Tutor)

## Domain Overview
The EdTech Math Tutor domain focuses on providing educational assistance for mathematics topics typically covered in classes 6-10 (middle school to early high school). This domain requires:

- **Accuracy**: Mathematical calculations must be precise
- **Clarity**: Explanations should be understandable for students
- **Step-by-step reasoning**: Complex problems need to be broken down
- **Educational value**: Responses should help students learn, not just provide answers

## Representative User Tasks

### 1. Solve Linear Equations Step-by-Step
**Example**: "Solve 3x + 5 = 14"
- **Goal**: Find the value of the variable
- **Expected approach**: Show algebraic steps clearly
- **Educational value**: Teach equation-solving methodology

### 2. Explain Geometric Formulas with Examples
**Example**: "What is the area of a triangle with base 8cm and height 6cm?"
- **Goal**: Apply geometric formulas correctly
- **Expected approach**: State formula, substitute values, calculate
- **Educational value**: Reinforce formula application

### 3. Generate Practice Problems for Specific Topics
**Example**: "Calculate 25% of 160"
- **Goal**: Solve percentage problems
- **Expected approach**: Convert percentage to decimal, multiply
- **Educational value**: Practice computational skills

## Domain Challenges
1. **Mathematical Precision**: Small errors can make answers completely wrong
2. **Age-Appropriate Language**: Must be understandable for 11-16 year olds
3. **Conceptual Understanding**: Not just computation, but explaining "why"
4. **Varied Topics**: Algebra, geometry, arithmetic, percentages, etc.

## Success Criteria
- **Accuracy**: Correct mathematical results
- **Clarity**: Clear, step-by-step explanations
- **Educational Value**: Helps students understand concepts
- **Consistency**: Reliable performance across different math topics
